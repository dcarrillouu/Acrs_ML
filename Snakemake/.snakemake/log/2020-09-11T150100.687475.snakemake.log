MissingOutputException in line 17 of /home/dani/Desktop/papers/Gussov_et_al_2020/Acrs_ML/Snakemake/process_PATRIC_proteins.smk:

/home/dani/Desktop/papers/Gussov_et_al_2020/Acrs_ML/test/fixed_PATRIC_proteins/1000561.3.lcl
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
